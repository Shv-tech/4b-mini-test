Light absorption by chlorophyll is a fundamental process in photosynthesis, enabling plants to convert light energy into chemical energy. Here's a step-by-step description of how this process occurs:\n\n1. **Structure of Chlorophyll**:  \n   Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells. Its structure includes a large ring (porphyrin ring) with a central magnesium ion (Mg\u00b2\u207a) and a long hydrophobic tail. The porphyrin ring is responsible for absorbing light, while the hydrophobic tail anchors the molecule in the thylakoid membrane.\n\n2. **Absorption of Light**:  \n   When light strikes a chlorophyll molecule, photons (particles of light) are absorbed by the electrons in the porphyrin ring. The energy from the photon excites an electron from the ground state to a higher energy level (excited state). This excitation occurs primarily in the blue (around 430 nm) and red (around 662 nm) wavelengths of the visible spectrum, while chlorophyll reflects green light, which is why plants appear green.\n\n3. **Energy Transfer**:  \n   The excited electron is transferred to an electron acceptor molecule (such as",

Total workout time for the week must not exceed 90 mins. 5. Output must be exactly 3 paragraphs. Each paragraph should describe one day's workout, including the type, duration, and key exercises. Ensure that no exercise contains the word \"squats\".\n\nOn Monday, the cardio session is designed to be efficient and effective, lasting 30 minutes. The workout includes a dynamic warm-up of 5 minutes, followed by 20 minutes of interval training using a combination of jogging, high knees, butt kicks, and mountain climbers. This is concluded with a 5-minute cool-down involving light stretching and deep breathing. The focus is on improving cardiovascular endurance while maintaining joint mobility and preventing injury. This session aligns with the requirement for a cardio day and fits within the 90-minute weekly limit.\n\nOn Wednesday, the leg-focused workout emphasizes strength and stability without incorporating any squat-based movements. The session runs for 30 minutes and begins with a 5-minute warm-up of leg swings, ankle circles, and light lunges. The main portion includes bodyweight lunges, step-ups (using a low bench or platform), leg presses (on a machine), and calf raises. These exercises target quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves while avoiding any form of squatting. The session ends with a 5-minute cool-down of static stretches for the lower",

    "successful_output": "2. Describe the process of light absorption by chlorophyll. Light absorption by chlorophyll is a fundamental process in photosynthesis, enabling plants to convert light energy into chemical energy. Here's a step-by-step description of how this process occurs:\n\n1. **Structure of Chlorophyll**:  \n   Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells. Its structure includes a large ring (porphyrin ring) with a central magnesium ion (Mg\u00b2\u207a) and a long hydrophobic tail. The porphyrin ring is responsible for absorbing light, while the hydrophobic tail anchors the molecule in the thylakoid membrane.\n\n2. **Absorption of Light**:  \n   When light strikes a chlorophyll molecule, photons (particles of light) are absorbed by the electrons in the porphyrin ring. The energy from the photon excites an electron from the ground state to a higher energy level (excited state). This excitation occurs primarily in the blue (around 430 nm) and red (around 662 nm) wavelengths of the visible spectrum, while chlorophyll reflects green light, which is why plants appear green.\n\n3. **Energy Transfer**:  \n   The excited electron is transferred to an electron acceptor molecule (such as",
